### `conda` environments

Since PsychoPy 3.x, it is possible to install `psychopy` via the `conda`
package manager. We recommend using the 
[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) distribution
on your OS, then opening a Terminal/Command prompt and running

```bash
conda env create -f environment-Win10.env
```

This will create an environment called `psypy` with the latest version
from PyPi. Edit the first line of the file if you want to name the
environment otherwise. Run

```bash
conda activate psypy
psychopy
```

to start the GUI.
